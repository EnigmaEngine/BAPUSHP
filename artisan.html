      <h1>Decline in Opportunity for Artisans</h1>
      <a href="http://www.firegold.com/firemen&artists.html"><img src="res/Artisan.png" style="float: right"></img></a>
      <p>While many people in antebellum America had increased opportunity due to
         the market revolution, many artisans and farmers were forced out of their
         careers into low paying, unskilled jobs.</p>

      <p>Prior to the market revolution, most manufacturing jobs were done by
         artisans. Artisans would own private shops or even work out of their homes,
         making products by hand. These “Master craftsman” would employ other
         artisans, known as journeymen and artisans. Journeymen were experienced
         craftsman who lacked capital to run their own shops, and would work in
         hopes of saving enough to do so later in life. Apprentices, who were
         typically teenage boys first entering the trade, would be taught through
         experience while also running errands for their employers. David Johnson
         recalls apprentices in the shoemaking business:</p>

      <p class="quote">“A boy while learning his trade was called a ‘seamster;’
                       that is, he sewed the shoes for his master, or employer, or
                       to use one of the technicalities of the ‘craft,’ he ‘worked
                       on the seam.’“(Johnson, David)</p>

      <p>However, this system of manufacturing saw a steep decline in the early
         19th century. In it’s place arose the “Putting-out-system.” This system
         was characterized by “Machineless Factories” where experienced
         manufacturers were replaced by multiple unskilled workers. Apprentices and
         Journeymen were forced to join these low-wage workers while their
         shop-owners became “Foremen.” This change also meant that workers no
         longer lived in the homes of their masters and masters no longer assumed
         paternalistic responsibility for their workers. The employee-employer
         relationship suddenly became significantly less personal and most
         importantly, work became subject to supply and demand. “Old Apprentice,”
         writing into the New York Observer in 1826 laments:</p>

      <p class="quote">“These men prefer that the boys should not be bound as in
                       that case there is nothing binding upon them. If the boy is
                       taken sick or is guilty of misconduct, he can be turned
                       adrift upon the public or his friends, and no responsibility
                       attached to the employer.”(pseudonym)</p>


      <p>This system then gave way to the factory system, in which significantly
         more work was performed in one location, with the help of newly invented
         machines. One of the first examples were the textile mills of Boston,
         specifically the Lowell Mill and the women it employed. Workers in these
         mills required little to no skill and therefore could be anyone. This meant
         that employers would hire those willing to work for the lowest wage and
         forced those looking for a job to accept those low wages, or have no job
         at all. While this system opened up independence and opportunity for
         Immigrants, Women and others, former journeymen and apprentices were
         forced into a situation significantly worse than what they had before. So
         much so that it caused conflict between these groups. Racism and Slavery
         were reinforced by the fear that Wages would be driven ever lower. As
         one man writes in 1838:</p>


      <p class="quote">“I am aware that most of you have too strong antipathy to
                       encourage the masonry and carpentry trades of your poor
                       white brothers, that your predilections for giving employment
                       in your line of business to ebony workers have either so
                       cheapened the white man’s labor, or expatriated hence with but
                       a few solitary exceptions, all the white masons and carpenters
                       of this town.”(Flournoy, J. J.)</p>

      <p>While the market revolution was mostly a positive event in America’s
         history, It is important to recall those adversely affected and the role
         they played in history. History may be written by winners, often the most
         can be learned from the losers.<p>
