      <p>During the antebellum era, the expansion of opportunity was becoming
         less limited for women, however there were still many things holding them
         back. Women were primarily held back by wealthy men, who refused to pay
         them equal to their other male employees some would describe this as even
         a tyrannical rule. This frustrated many of the women in wage working jobs
         and resulted in things like the lowell mill strike.</p>

      <p>The lowell mill strike was a fairly large strike done by the workers at
         the lowell mill in 1836, it was not very successful because they owners
         of the mill simply ignored the workers for the most part and it did not
         take long before most of them got back to work, they also knew that their
         positions could be fairly easily filled so they did not try to upset the
         mill owners anymore. Even though protests like the lowell mill strike of
         1836 failed, the majority of women rights activists were not discouraged by
         this and continued to campaign for their rights, conventions like seneca
         falls in 1848 had massive influences on the women's rights campaign, it
         influenced even more women to join the movement.</p>

      <p>Another result of the women's rights campaign was women's fertility
         which dropped sharply, greatly due to the fact that women wanted smaller
         more manageable families, this is not the norm for the time, most women
         had many children and spent most if not all of their time taking care of
         them and the house, with such a drastic change in social view of women it
         was quite frightening to many men, especially in the south where the idea
         of a southern lady was very nearly the opposite of what these women
         wanted to be like. The women's rights movement also branched off of other
         minority rights movements like the movement to free the slaves or give
         equality to all men regardless of color. Women would continue to push for
         their rights, for equal pay, equal social status, and the right to vote
         being just a few. However it would not be for some time that women
         finally got their well deserved rights.</p>
