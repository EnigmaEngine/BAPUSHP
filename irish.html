      <h1>Aspects of Immigration</h1>
      <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zijEKKK1V_I/TmWo3konvaI/AAAAAAAAA3M/tS9SLHkFniE/s1600/Irish+Immigrants.jpg"><img src="res/Irish.jpg" style="float: left"></img></a>
      <p>The early to mid 19th century in the United States brought many new
         opportunities for minorities, and less privileged peoples. These new
         opportunities arose through the development of new technology and the
         trend of record amounts of immigration into the United States. One major
         factor that lead to the increase of immigration into the US was the
         development of more efficient transportation technology. An example of
         more effective transportation was the development of a railroad system
         in the US, and the ability to go across seas by steamboat. These new
         developing forms of technology made it much less expensive, and made it
         much quicker to get from place to place. It would only cost you 150$ to
         go from San Fransisco to New York in only six or seven days(Rev. Stephen
         Byrne. “Irish Emigration to the United States: what it has been, and what
         it is.”).</p>

      <p>Another factor that lead to a high influx of Irish immigrants settling
         in the United States was the potato famine. This epidemic lead to a high
         number of deaths in Ireland and caused a large number of Ireland's
         inhabitants to move to the United States, hoping that they would be able
         to escape poverty. This sense of having little to lose, since they had
         came from a poverty and disease struck country, lead to a great opportunity
         for the Irish looking for jobs. This opportunity was the fact that they
         were willing to work hard, and were willing to work for much less than
         the white working class. This allowed the Irish to get low paying jobs,
         such as working in factories or mining.</p>

      <p>There also was a large influx of Germans immigrating into the United States
         due to the state of civil unrest in Germany. The number of Germans that
         migrated to the United States was equivalent to that of the number of
         Irish immigrants (“Irish and German Immigration.” US History.). Many of
         these germans that were coming to the United States came to escape
         economic hardship and political unrest which was a result of rioting and
         rebellion.</p>

      <p>Although there were a large number of opportunities for immigrants due
         to the fact that they were willing to work for very little, this also
         lead to them having the disadvantage that they were expected to work for
         less than the white working class. At first this worked for them, in
         that it was very easy for immigrants to find jobs. But over time it
         started to become a disadvantage because not only would they have to
         work much harder for much less, but they also couldn’t try to get better
         pay. This was because if they tried to go on strike or riot against the
         poor pay, there were enough immigrants that they could easily be replaced
         by someone who was willing to work for cheap.</p>
