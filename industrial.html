      <h1>The Empowerment of the Poor</h1>

      <p>By the 1820’s there was sweeping change throughout America. The Industrial
         revolution brought sweeping change to the young nation and its economy.
         This change not only altered the way that the government handled trade,
         but this revolution in manufacturing also brought stark changes to the
         everyday lives of millions of Americans (“The Industrial Revolution in
         the United States”). Protective tariffs were put into place to protect
         American manufacturers from British competition and this is what set off
         the industrialization of early America (though this would later cause
         turmoil and lead to the Nullification Crisis) (Boundless. “Protective
         Tariffs.”)</p>

      <p>With this sweeping change in the early American economy had opened doors
         for many American’s that previously struggled to gain a foothold on the
         social ladder — particularly the poor. Post-Industrial Revolution America
         saw the rise of the wage worker and factory job. Before the Industrial
         Revolution the American manufacturing sector (as limited as it was) was
         limited to the crafts of individual artisans and farmers. Things changed
         after the Industrial Revolution, people could make a living off of factory
         work alone. Workers no longer needed to be skilled artisans, rather,
         anyone could enter into factory work and make a living. (Bessen. "What
         looms tell us about workers, wages.")</p>

      <p>The epitome of the factory movement is Lowell Mill. Lowell was one of
         the first examples of a factory community. Lowell was unique in the fact
         that it offered its workers a holistic environment with many opportunities
         for advancement. One worker kept a diary on her day-to-day life at the
         mill containing excerpts such as:<p>

      <p class="quote">“March 12 - Morning. Attending Mr. Woodman's church on
                       Merrimac St. Was less pleased with the service than any
                       other save the Catholic that I have attended. Heard Dr.
                       Robinson's experience at the City Hall”</p>

      <p class="quote">“March 21 - Went to the Museum”</p>

      <p class="quote">“April 3 - Attended Mr. Grey's Geological lecture at the
                       John St. vestry.” (Susan. Caught Between Two Worlds: The
                       Diary of A Lowell Mill Girl)</p>

      <p>These sorts of journal entries depict a life of culture and even education.
         Of course most of their time was still spent working at the mills, but
         working at Lowell provided access to things historically out of reach
         to the poor and women.</p>

      <p>While the industrial revolution was providing the lower class with
         opportunities for economic advancement, the political arena was
         transforming as well. The 1840’s saw the first expansion of suffrage
         in American history. By 1840 nearly 90% of white men possessed the right
         to vote ("The Expansion of the Vote: A White Man's Democracy."). Prior
         to the expansion of suffrage throughout the early 1800’s, only
         landowners had the right to vote.</p>

      <p>Naturally, this huge expansion of the voting population led to the rise
         of new politics, in this case, Populism. While the majority of presidents
         preceding Jackson saw themselves as valiant leader and were often
         perceived as part of the elite, Jackson, the result of a radically new
         American democracy, saw himself as one of the people. He made it clear
         that he would disrupt the old way of things and usher in a dramatically
         new vision for the future.</p>

      <p class="quote">“The recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes,
                       on the list of executive duties, in characters too legible
                       to be overlooked, the task of reform; which will require,
                       particularly, the correction of those abuses that have
                       brought the patronage of the Federal Government into conflict
                       with the freedom of elections.” (Andrew Jackson)</p>

      <p>Here, Jackson directly challenged the establishment and banks on the
         support of “public sentiment” to execute this. He does not see himself
         as a worker of the government, but rather worker for the people. This
         trend toward populism and democratization provided millions of men with
         the opportunity to have a say in politics where their voices had
         previously been silenced.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the early 1800’s brought about massive economic and
         political change that ultimately enabled the lower and middle classes
         to advance in the new country. The shift toward wage labor and
         industrialization allowed for new economic opportunity available even to
         those without marketable skills or land, and the democratization of
         politics alongside the expansion of suffrage gave this new middle-class
         the opportunity to have a voice. Ultimately these new developments were
         another step toward the ideal that is the American Dream.</p>
